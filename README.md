## Introduction
Deepfake audio detection involves the use of advanced ML and DL techniques to distinguish between real and synthetic audio. This project aims to provide a reliable tool for real-time detection of Deepfake audio using a user-friendly web interface built with Flask.

## Features
- Real-time detection of Deepfake audio
- User-friendly web interface
- Utilizes ML and DL models for accurate detection
- Visual representation of audio features

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AshishY3103/DeepFake_Audio_Detection.git
    cd DeepFake_Audio_Detection
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
